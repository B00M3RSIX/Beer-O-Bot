# FollowCommand.msg
# Custom message to configure person following behavior

# Target selection
string target_id                 # ID of the person to follow (empty = follow currently tracked)

# Following parameters
float32 desired_distance         # Desired following distance in meters
float32 max_distance             # Maximum distance before increasing speed
float32 min_distance             # Minimum distance before stopping/backing up

# Positional preference
uint8 position_mode              # How to position relative to person
float32 position_angle           # Preferred angle in radians (0 = directly behind)

# Speed limits
float32 max_linear_speed         # Maximum linear speed (m/s)
float32 max_angular_speed        # Maximum angular speed (rad/s)

# Behavior configuration
bool maintain_visibility         # Whether to prioritize keeping person in view
                                 # (may override optimal path planning)
bool avoid_obstacles             # Whether to prioritize obstacle avoidance
                                 # (may temporarily lose person tracking)

# Recovery behavior
uint8 recovery_mode              # What to do when person is lost
uint16 max_search_duration       # Maximum time to search before giving up (seconds)

# Position mode constants
uint8 POSITION_BEHIND = 0        # Follow directly behind the person
uint8 POSITION_SIDE = 1          # Follow to the side of the person
uint8 POSITION_ANGLE = 2         # Follow at specified angle
uint8 POSITION_ADAPTIVE = 3      # Adaptively position based on environment

# Recovery mode constants
uint8 RECOVERY_STOP = 0          # Stop in place when target is lost
uint8 RECOVERY_LAST_POSITION = 1 # Go to last known position
uint8 RECOVERY_SEARCH = 2        # Actively search for the person
uint8 RECOVERY_RETURN_HOME = 3   # Return to home position
